## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Dexter Mehta

I’m a Software Engineer <Twemoji emoji="laptop" /> based in **Brisbane, Australia** <Twemoji emoji="world" /> with a passion for full-stack development and AI-powered solutions. I'm aspiring to be a great software engineer, while sprinkling machine-learning magic wherever I can. My academic quest earned me a **Master’s in Information Technology** <Twemoji emoji="grad" /> with a major in Computer Science, and my curiosity hasn’t slowed down since.

My days are split between writing production-ready code, tinkering with side projects, and leveling up my AI toolkit, right now it’s all about **PyTorch experiments and prompt-engineering deep dives**. Continuous learning is my jam, and I love turning newfound knowledge into real, working features that make users go “whoa.”

When I’m not buried in code, you’ll catch me **groovin’ to hip-hop beats** <Twemoji emoji="headphones" />, **powerlifting at the gym**, or unwinding with a good **action movie marathon** <Twemoji emoji="movie" />. These hobbies keep my creativity flowing and my mind fresh, so I’m always primed for the next big leap in tech.
